<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Focus Search helps users open third-party apps (e.g., YouTube, Reddit, Instagram) directly with search terms. We are not affiliated with or responsible for the content, functionality, or data practices of any third-party apps.

We are not liable for such disruptions but will try to accommodate reasonable updates when feasible.</span></p>
