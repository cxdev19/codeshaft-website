        <h2>9. Warranty Disclaimers</h2>
        <p><strong>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (AND SUBJECT TO ANY MANDATORY CONSUMER RIGHTS IN YOUR
                JURISDICTION), THE APP IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.</strong></p>
        <p>We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not
            limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and

        <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

        <h3>10.1 EU Consumer Protections</h3>
        <p>Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by our
            negligence, fraud, or any other liability that cannot be excluded by applicable law.</p>

        <h3>10.2 Exclusion of Damages</h3>
        <p>SUBJECT TO SECTION 10.1 AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
            INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER
            INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING
            FROM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the App;</li>
            <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the App;</li>

        <p>You acknowledge that the limitations of liability set forth in this section are fundamental elements of the
            agreement between you and us. The App would not be provided without such limitations.</p>

        <h2>11. Third-Party Services and Integrations</h2>
        <p>Our App relies on various third-party tools to function effectively, such as RevenueCat (for subscriptions)
            and PostHog (for analytics). By using Lumi, you acknowledge that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not control these external services and are not responsible for their content, accuracy, or
                availability.</li>
            <li>Your interactions with these services are governed by their own separate terms and privacy policies.
            </li>
            <li>We are not liable for any issues or damages that arise from your use of these third-party integrations.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. App Modifications and Updates</h2>

        <h3>12.1 Changes to the Service</h3>

            at any time, with or without notice. We will not be liable to you or any third party for any such changes or
            interruptions.</p>

        <h3>12.2 Updates to These Terms</h3>
        <p>We may revise this agreement periodically to reflect changes in our service or legal requirements. The "Last
            Updated" date at the top constitutes the effective date of the new terms. Your continued use of the App
            after any changes signifies your acceptance of the updated agreement. If you do not agree to the new terms,
            you must stop using the App.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination of Use</h2>

        <h3>13.1 User Termination</h3>
        <p>You can stop using Lumi at any time by deleting the App from your device. Please note that deleting the App
            does <strong>not</strong> automatically cancel your subscription; you must manually cancel it through your
            Apple ID settings to avoid future charges.</p>

        <h3>13.2 Developer Termination</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the App immediately and without notice if we
            determine that you have violated these Terms or engaged in conduct that is harmful to us or other users.</p>

        <h3>13.3 Effects of Termination</h3>
        <p>Upon termination, all rights and licenses granted to you by these Terms will instantly cease. You must stop
            all use of the App and delete it from your devices. Provisions regarding ownership, warranty disclaimers,
            indemnity, and limitations of liability will survive termination.</p>

        <h2>14. Geographic Restrictions</h2>
        <p>Lumi is operated from our location and we make no claims that it is appropriate or available for use in all
            jurisdictions. If you access the App from outside our home jurisdiction, you do so on your own initiative
            and are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p>

        <h2>15. Apple App Store Terms</h2>
        <p>Since you are downloading the App from the Apple App Store, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
        <ul>

                enforce them against you.</li>
        </ul>
