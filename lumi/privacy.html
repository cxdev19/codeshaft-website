        <h1>Privacy Policy for Lumi</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: February 11, 2026</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Lumi ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you
            use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent
            about our data practices.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Data You Voluntarily Share</h3>
        <p>When you start using Lumi, you may choose to provide us with specific details to enhance your experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personalization Inputs:</strong> This includes your current emotional state (mood), key
                challenges you are facing, and your self-improvement goals. We use this to curate affirmations that
                resonate with you.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Basics:</strong> Optional information such as your age group or gender identity, which
                helps us refine our content recommendations.</li>
            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences for when and how often you'd like to receive notifications.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.2 Data Collected Automatically</h3>
        <p>To ensure the App functions correctly and to improve its performance, we automatically log certain
            non-personal data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Specs:</strong> Your device model, operating system version, and the version of the
                App you are running.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity Metrics:</strong> Anonymous insights into how you interact with the App (e.g., which
                screens are visited most), tracked via PostHog.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Records:</strong> Receipt validation data necessary to verify and maintain your
                "Pro" subscription status.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Sensitive Data</h3>
        <p>While we process your mood and goal inputs to provide the service, we do not link this data to your
            real-world identity (like your name or email address) in our analytics.</p>

        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
        <p>We process the collected data for the following specific business purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tailored Experience:</strong> To deliver content that matches the mood and goals you selected.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Product Enhancement:</strong> To analyze user behavior trends so we can fix bugs and build
                requested features.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Administration:</strong> To manage your subscription tiers and ensure you have access to
                paid features.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication:</strong> To send you the daily affirmations you have requested via push
                notifications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-party services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services that may collect information:</p>

                receipts. <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank">View Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>PostHog:</strong> Provides app analytics. They help us understand app usage without identifying
                individual users. <a href="https://posthog.com/privacy" target="_blank">View Policy</a>.</li>

                affirmations you write, are stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Retention Period:</strong> We retain analytical data only for as long as necessary to improve
                our service, after which it is deleted or aggregated. You can clear your local data at any time by
                deleting the App.</li>
