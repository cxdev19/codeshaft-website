    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: 7 June 2025</em></p>

    <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Onboard handles your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Onboard does not collect any personal information or usage data. All data related to your app usage, preferences, and progress is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Onboard does not use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking services. Your activity within the app remains entirely private and local to your device.</p>

    <h2>3. Payments</h2>
    <p>Payments for subscriptions and in-app purchases are processed securely through Apple’s App Store. Onboard does not process or store any payment information directly. Please refer to Apple's terms and policies regarding payments, refunds, and subscription management.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored only on your device, you are responsible for securing your device and any information stored within Onboard. We do not have access to your data and cannot retrieve it if your device is lost or damaged.</p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Onboard is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our app or legal requirements. In the event of significant changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify users through the app or via email (if applicable). Continued use of Onboard after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
