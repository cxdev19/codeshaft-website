        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your")
            and the developer of NoteSpend ("Developer," "we," "us," or "our") governing your use of the NoteSpend

        <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
        <p>NoteSpend is a financial tracking tool that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to parse natural language notes
            into structured transaction data.</p>

        <h2>3. AI Disclaimer (Important)</h2>
        <div class="warning">
            <strong>NoteSpend is NOT a financial advisor.</strong>
        </div>
        <p>The App uses AI to interpret your text. While we strive for accuracy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> AI may occasionally misinterpret amounts, categories, or dates. You are
                responsible for verifying the accuracy of all transactions recorded.</li>

            <li>Attempts to manipulate or abuse AI systems</li>

        <p>These limits reset at the start of each billing period. Exceeding these limits may result in temporary
            restriction of AI features until the next billing period.</p>

        <h3>5.1 Abuse Prevention</h3>
        <p>We monitor usage patterns to prevent abuse. Automated, scripted, or excessive use may result in:</p>
