            <h2>15. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. We will provide notice of material changes through the App or by other means.

If you do not agree to the modified Terms, your sole remedy is to discontinue use of the App.</p>

            <h2>16. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Developer resides, without regard to conflict of law principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.</p>

            <h3>17.2 Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p>If informal resolution fails, any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court.

            <h3>17.3 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p class="important">YOU AND THE DEVELOPER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

            <h3>17.4 Jury Trial Waiver</h3>

            <h2>18. Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable while preserving the parties' original intent.</p>

            <h2>19. Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and the Developer regarding the App and supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, representations, warranties, and understandings, whether written or oral.</p>

            <h2>20. No Waiver</h2>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by us.</p>
